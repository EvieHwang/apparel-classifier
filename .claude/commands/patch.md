Quick bounded change — use for bugs, tweaks, polish, or small features where the intent is clear and the work fits in a single session. No feature artifacts are produced — the PR is the documentation.

**Owner-decision stops notify.** Nothing here adds a stop — this command stops only where it already says to and proceeds autonomously everywhere else. But *when* it does stop for a decision or confirmation only the owner can give (e.g. plan approval before implementing), raise it through the `AskUserQuestion` tool rather than ending the turn with trailing prose: in a cloud/web/mobile session the question is what notifies the owner that the run is waiting on them. Phrase it as the real decision and keep "Other" open for a freeform reply. This changes how a stop surfaces, never whether one happens.

Before proposing the change:
- Read constitution.md and CLAUDE.md.
- If this work is refining output from an earlier feature, read that feature's existing artifacts in features/[name]/.
- Identify the minimal change that achieves the intent.

Present the plan. Include: what's changing, why, and what the change could break or affect. Wait for approval before implementing.

Implement only the minimal change. Do not refactor adjacent code, rename, or expand scope — even if you see opportunities.

After implementing:
- Run existing tests — every runner in constitution.md's `## Testing` whose code this change touched (a polyglot repo has more than one).
- If a test fails: attempt one remediation. If it still fails, stop and report rather than proceeding.

Commit using conventional commit format (one commit per logical unit).

Open a PR. The PR body is the record of this change:
- **Intent** — what you set out to do and why.
- **Change** — what was actually modified.
- **Verification** — tests run and any manual checks.
- **Risk** — what this could affect; anything to watch in subsequent work.

Exit condition: existing tests pass and the PR is open.
